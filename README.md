# Starting a blog!


At the beginning of 2017, I decided to learn more about data visualization. I was really interested in data, and I had done some design jobs, so it seemed like a perfect fit. But the whole year I was so crippled by self-doubt, and fear, that I didn’t end up learning nearly as much as I wanted to. This blog is a way for me to document learning about design, data analysis and data visualization.


Right now, it’s January 2018, and I’m done sitting and waiting for motivation and inspiration to teach me everything I need to know about design and data visualization. I know that if I want to have great career opportunities, I have to start building some awesome skills, and first up, it’s COLOR THEORY!


Color theory has been a big mental hurdle, keeping me from envisioning a future in a design-related career. So although I’m not going to become an expert, I really want some tools to feel more confident when I’m picking colors for a design. I’m starting a LinkedIn Learning course on color theory, and I’ll be posting the stuff that I learn, and the tiny, mini projects that I’m doing to solidify the concepts! Yey!!!
